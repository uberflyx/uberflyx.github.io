The system utilizes a combination of Power Line Communication (PLC) and Visible Light Communication (VLC) technologies to create a robust information transmission network. By modifying LED-based miners' headlamps to emit unique, imperceptible signatures and installing sensors throughout the mine, the system enables continuous location tracking of miners. Additional features include pedometers for movement monitoring and temperature sensors for environmental tracking. This comprehensive approach not only enhances rescue efforts in emergencies but also provides valuable data for optimizing mining operations, improving both safety and efficiency.","highlights":["Technology Innovation Agency (South Africa)","Partners: Ling Cheng (Wits)"],"url":""}],"volunteer":[{"organization":"IEEE Globecom Workshops, South Africa","position":"(Co-Chair) Workshop on Optical Wireless Communications: Energy Efficiency, Resilience, and Pervasive Coverage","startDate":"2024","endDate":"2024","url":"https://globecom2024.ieee-globecom.org/workshop/ws-20-workshop-optical-wireless-communications-energy-efficiency-resilience-and-pervasive"},{"organization":"Optica Laser Congress and Exhibition, Japan","position":"(Committee) Applications of Lasers for Sensing and Free Space Communications (LS&C)","startDate":"2024","endDate":"2024","url":"https://www.optica.org/events/congress/laser_congress/program/lasers_for_sensing_and_free_space_communications/"},{"organization":"Seventh International Conference on Optical Angular Momentum (ICOAM), South Africa","position":"Local Organising Committee","startDate":"2024","endDate":"2024","url":"https://www.wits.ac.za/icoam2024"},{"organization":"Optica (formerly The Optical Society / OSA)","position":"Applied Optics Topical Editor","startDate":"2023","endDate":"Present"},{"organization":"Optica (formerly The Optical Society / OSA)","position":"Optica Ambassador","startDate":"2023","endDate":"Present"},{"organization":"Wits Senate eResearch Committee","position":"Faculty of Engineering Representative","startDate":"2022","endDate":"Present"},{"organization":"Wits-Optics Student Chapter","position":"Chapter Advisor","startDate":"2021","endDate":"Present"},{"organization":"Wits Senate ICT Committee","position":"Faculty of Engineering Representative","startDate":"2019","endDate":"Present"},{"organization":"South African Institute of Physics","position":"Photonics Division Committee Member","startDate":"2018","endDate":"2024"}],"memberships":[{"organization":"South African Institute of Electrical Engineers (SAIEE)","position":"Member"},{"organization":"IEEE","position":"Senior Member","summary":"IEEE Communication and Photonics Societies"},{"organization":"SPIE","position":"Member"},{"organization":"Optica","position":"Member"},{"organization":"South African Institute of Physics (SAIP)","position":"Member"}]}
