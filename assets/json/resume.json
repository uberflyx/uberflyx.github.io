Despite high mobile coverage in South Africa, affordability remains a significant barrier. The research aims to narrow this gap by integrating innovative optical wireless technology with existing community WiFi networks. Collaborating with RIOT Network and PeCo Power, the project will enhance network speed and reliability while ensuring consistent operation through solar power solutions, particularly crucial during frequent power outages. This approach seeks to provide more affordable and accessible internet connectivity in low-income urban areas.",

The system utilizes a combination of Power Line Communication (PLC) and Visible Light Communication (VLC) technologies to create a robust information transmission network. By modifying LED-based miners' headlamps to emit unique, imperceptible signatures and installing sensors throughout the mine, the system enables continuous location tracking of miners. Additional features include pedometers for movement monitoring and temperature sensors for environmental tracking. This comprehensive approach not only enhances rescue efforts in emergencies but also provides valuable data for optimizing mining operations, improving both safety and efficiency.",
